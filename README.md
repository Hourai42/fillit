# fillit
2nd Project, complete on Dec 21st, 2017! 

However, this project won't be norminetted as I will be turning my partner's project in. 

Both of us have working projects and solutions, but I figure it'll be too much effort to Norm both. We used the same checking/parsing files, but we came up with different algorithms to find the smallest square given a list of tetriminos. 

I will also be uploading the project my partner and I are turning in as "fillitTeam". 

Runtimes for: 8 horizontal lines
My code: 44.982 seconds
Partner's code: 2:49:44.
